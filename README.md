# Obsidian Menu Navigation

This is a very simple plugin that allows you to navigate modal options using vim/emacs style bindings.

It essentially works by listening for keyboard events while any `.prompt` class element is visible on the page and then dispatches the appropriate arrow key event.

## Usage

While a modal is open (e.g. quick switcher or command palette) press Ctrl-j or Ctrl-n to cycle forward and Ctrl-k or Ctrl-p to cycle backward.

That's it!
